CurrencyText is a lightweight framework for formating text field text as currency üí≤. It provides an _easy to use_, and _extendable_ `UITextFieldDelegate`, that can be plugged to _any_ text field. Yes, *no* need to use a specific UITextField subclass üòâ.

Its main core, the `CurrencyFormatter` class, can also be used _a part from text fields_ to format any value that can be monetary represented.

If you need to present currency formatted text or allow users to input currency data, `CurrencyText` is going to help you do it in a highly readable and configurable matter.

## Introduction to `CurrencyFormatter`

CurrencyText is made upon `CurrencyFormatter`, which is an a wrapper around number formatter with currency number style. It can be used alone or injected into a `CurrencyTextFieldDelegate` to auto format text field's inputs.

<a name="basics"/>

### Basic setup

The `CurrencyFormatter` encapsulates number formatter's currency properties.

Creating a `CurrencyFormatter` instance is pretty simple; you can use the readable builder pattern approach where the init class require a callback in which the self instance is passed, allowing you to configure your properties by keeping the code clean and readable ([Inspired by SwiftRichString](https://github.com/malcommac/SwiftRichString)):

```swift
let formatter = CurrencyFormatter {
  $0.currency = .euro
  // ... set any other attribute
}

let formattedString = formatter.string(from: 30.0) //‚Ç¨30.00
```

<a name="currencyandlocale"/>

### `Currency and locale` - easily defining formatting style

To define the currency style (symbol, formatting, separators) you must make use of `currency` and `locale` properties.
It's important to say that when these are not defined, the current user locale is automatically set, and so is the curency formatting. 
For example if the user Locale's is set to `pt_BR` (indentifier), the amount of 100 would be shown as `R$ 100,00`. What can be made by setting currency to brazilianReal and locale to portugueseBrazil when needed.

<a name="locale"/>

#### `Locale` - setting currency's locale
###### All locales were extracted from [jacobbubu - ioslocaleidentifiers](https://gist.github.com/jacobbubu/1836273)
The `CurrencyLocale` type wraps all available Locale identifiers in an enum type. 
Formatter's `locale` property can be set passing a common system Locale or one of CurrencyLocale's cases, such as .italian, .danish or .chinese. 
Note that you can define locale and compose it with a different currency of your choice, what is going to change generally only the currency symbol.

```swift
public enum CurrencyLocale: String, LocaleConvertible {
    
    case current = "current"
    case autoUpdating = "currentAutoUpdating"
    
    case afrikaans = "af"
    case afrikaansNamibia = "af_NA"
    case afrikaansSouthAfrica = "af_ZA"
    //...
}
```

<a name="currency"/>

#### `Currency` - how to choose a specific currency from it's name
###### encapsulates the cases of [ISO 4217 international standard for currency codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html)
The `Currency` type contains the currency codes as enum cases raw values, what makes it easier to set up the formatter with the currency that you want, such as .euro, .dollar, .brazilianReal.

```swift
public enum Currency: String {
    case afghani = "AFN",
    algerianDinar = "DZD",
    argentinePeso = "ARS"
    //...
}
```

Note that defining currency does not always goes as planned, because the most part of the format generally changes accordingly to user locale. For example, setting .euro as currency but with default user locale (Brazil), has the euro's currency symbol with separators and remaining style as used in Brazil.

```swift
let formatter = CurrencyFormatter {
  $0.currency = .dollar
  $0.locale = CurrencyLocale.englishUnitedStates
}

let formattedString = formatter.string(from: 30.0) //$30.00
```

<a name="advancedsetup"/>

### Advanced setup

For those cases where your design requires a custom presentation you are able to heavily customize the formatter.
We can remove decimals, set a maximum allowed value, customize grouping size or even set a hole new currency symbol. It is all up to you.

```swift
let formatter = CurrencyFormatter {
  $0.hasDecimals = false
  $0.maxValue = 999999
  $0.groupingSize = 2
  $0.groupingSeparator = ";"
  $0.currencySymbol = "üí∂"
}

let formattedString = formatter.string(from: 100000000) //üí∂99;99;99
```

## The `CurrencyTextFieldDelegate` - formatting user input as currency

`CurrencyTextFieldDelegate` is a type that inherits from `UITextFieldDelegate`, and provide a simple interface to configure how the inputs are configured as currency. It can be used with any `UITextField`.

<a name="setting"/>

### Setting your text field to format the inputs
To start formatting user's input as currency, you need to initialize a `CurrencyTextFieldDelegate` instance passing in a currency formatter configured as you wish, and then set it as the text field's delegate.

```Swift
let currencyFormatter = CurrencyFormatter()
textFieldDelegate = CurrencyUITextFieldDelegate(formatter: currencyFormatter)
textFieldDelegate.clearsWhenValueIsZero = true

textField.delegate = textFieldDelegate
```

Just by setting a currency text field delegate object to your text field, with given formatter behavior, the user inputs are going to be formatted as expected.

<a name="passthrough"/>

### Using the passthrough delegate
The `passthroughDelegate` property on a `CurrencyTextFieldDelegate` instance, can be used to 
listen and pottentially handle `UITextFieldDelegate events` that are sent to `CurrencyUITextFieldDelegate`.
It can be useful to intercept the delegate calls when `e.g.` tracking analytics events.

But be **aware** and **make sure** the implementation of this object _does not wrongly interfere with currency formatting_, `e.g.` by returning `false` on`textField(textField:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)` no currency formatting is done.

```Swift
let currencyTextFieldDelegate = CurrencyUITextFieldDelegate(formatter: currencyFormatter)
currencyTextFieldDelegate.passthroughDelegate = selfTextFieldDelegateListener

textField.delegate = currencyTextFieldDelegate

// all call to `currencyTextFieldDelegate` `UITextField` delegate methods will be forwarded to `selfTextFieldDelegateListener`.
```

<a name="negative"/>

### Allowing users to input `negative values`
If you want your users to be able to input negative values just set textField's `keyboardType` to `.numbersAndPunctuation`, so whenever users tap the negative symbol it will be correctly presented and handled.

```Swift
textField.keyboardType = .numbersAndPunctuation

// users inputs "-3456"
// -R$ 34.56
```

<a name="properties"/>

## Properties available via `CurrencyFormatter` class
